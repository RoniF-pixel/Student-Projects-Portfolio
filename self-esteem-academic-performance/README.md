# Self-Esteem and Academic Performance

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between students' self-esteem levels and their academic performance (GPA). It was part of a student-led undergraduate research study I supported and supervised, recreated here for portfolio purposes using simulated data.

## 🎯 Objective
To examine whether self-esteem scores, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, are significantly associated with students’ academic performance (GPA).

## 🧰 Tools Used
- [x] SPSS  
- [ ] R  
- Simulated survey data modeled after a real student project

## 📊 Data Description
- **Source:** Simulated dataset based on the original project structure
- **Variables:**
  - `self_esteem_score`: Composite score from the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale
  - `gpa`: Self-reported Grade Point Average
- **Sample size:** 100 simulated student responses

## 🔍 Statistical Methods
- Descriptive statistics (mean, SD)
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- Simple linear regression

## 📈 Key Results
- A moderate positive correlation was found between self-esteem scores and GPA.
- Regression analysis showed that self-esteem was a statistically significant predictor of GPA.

> Note: These results are based on simulated data and mirror typical patterns observed in similar student studies.

## 🔐 Ethics & Privacy
- The dataset is entirely simulated for demonstration purposes.
- No original student data is shared in this repository.

## 🔄 Reproducibility
- SPSS syntax file is included in `/analysis/self_esteem_gpa_analysis.sps`
- Simulated dataset is included in `/data/self_esteem_gpa.sav` and `.csv` format
- Sample visualizations (correlation plots, regression line) are available in `/visuals`
