# Undergraduate Student Research Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing collaborative data analysis projects completed with undergraduate students. These projects span a wide range of topics in psychology, education, and behavioral science, with a focus on survey-based research and statistical interpretation using SPSS and R.

As a statistician and data consultant, I have worked with students to help them design surveys, clean and analyze data, choose appropriate statistical tests, and interpret findings. This portfolio presents a structured, anonymized overview of 20 selected student research projects.

> **Note:** All data and files in this repository are either simulated or anonymized for privacy protection. No real personal or sensitive student data is shared here.
