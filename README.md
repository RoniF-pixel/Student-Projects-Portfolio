# Undergraduate Student Research Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing collaborative data analysis projects completed with undergraduate students. These projects span a wide range of topics in psychology, education, and behavioral science, with a focus on survey-based research and statistical interpretation using SPSS and R.

As a statistician and data consultant, I have worked with students to help them design surveys, clean and analyze data, choose appropriate statistical tests, and interpret findings. This portfolio presents a structured, anonymized overview of 20 selected student research projects.

> **Note:** All data and files in this repository are either simulated or anonymized for privacy protection. No real personal or sensitive student data is shared here.

## 📊 Project Categories

- **Mental Health & Emotions** (e.g., anxiety, depression, mood)
- **Learning & Academics** (e.g., GPA, study habits, online learning)
- **Behavior & Lifestyle** (e.g., smartphone use, sleep, exercise)
- **Social & Environmental Factors** (e.g., bullying, peer relations, family income)

Each project is hosted in its own folder with:
- A summary of the research purpose
- Description of inputs and survey design
- Analysis approach (SPSS or R)
- Methods used (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, regression)
- Simulated sample data (when possible)
- Visualizations and interpretation of results
