# Introduction
Gratitude journaling has been associated with improved emotional well-being and reduced stress. This study simulates a 2-week longitudinal intervention comparing gratitude journaling and neutral journaling on subjective happiness and stress levels.

# Data Overview
```{r laoding data{}
setwd("C:/Users/0&1/OneDrive/Documents/Student-Projects-Portfolio/gratitude_wellbeing")
data <- read.csv("gratitude_wellbeing_data.csv")
head(data)
summary(data)
```

- Groups: Gratitude vs. Neutral

- Measures:

   - Happiness: Pre and Post

   - Stress: Pre and Post

   - Compliance over 14 days
   
# Mixed-Effects Model: Happiness Over Time
We fit a mixed-effects model with random intercepts per subject.

```{r}
data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Happiness_Pre, Happiness_Post),
               names_to = "Time", values_to = "Happiness") %>%
  mutate(Time = factor(Time, levels = c("Happiness_Pre", "Happiness_Post")),
         SubjectID = factor(SubjectID))

model <- lmer(Happiness ~ Time * Group + (1 | SubjectID), data = data_long)
summary(model)
```

```{r}
library(lmerTest)
summary(lmer(Happiness ~ Group * Time + (1 | SubjectID), data = data_long))
```

# Result
A significant Time Ã— Group interaction was found (p = 0.008), indicating steeper gains in happiness for the gratitude group.

# Independent t-Test: Stress Reduction
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(Stress_Reduction = Stress_Pre - Stress_Post)

t_test <- t.test(Stress_Reduction ~ Group, data = data)
t_test
```

# Result
Stress levels decreased more in the Gratitude group than the Neutral group (p = 0.01).

# Handling Missing Data (Example)
Let's assume some missing happiness scores and use multiple imputation.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
data_miss <- data
data_miss$Happiness_Post[sample(1:nrow(data), 5)] <- NA

imp <- mice(data_miss, m = 5, method = "pmm", seed = 500)
summary(imp)

# Pool model
completed_data <- complete(imp, 1)
head(completed_data)
```

#Assumption Checks

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(model)
qqnorm(resid(model)); qqline(resid(model))
```

# Conclusion
The gratitude journaling group experienced significantly greater increases in happiness and reduced stress levels over the 2-week period. These results support the use of gratitude interventions to enhance psychological well-being.
